Question 1: There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica?

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(iris)
iris.set1 <- subset(iris,Species=="virginica") 
round(mean(iris.set1$Sepal.Length),0)
```

Question 2: Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?

```{R}
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
```

Question 3: 

```{R}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
```
```{R}
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
```
```{R}
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))
```

Question 4:
If you run
debug(ls)
what happens when you next call the 'ls' function?

-> Execution of 'ls' will suspend at the beginning of the function and you will be in the browser.
